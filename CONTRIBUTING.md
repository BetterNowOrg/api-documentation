Please feel free to open issues on this repository if you have questions about
the documentation or the API in general.

We're using [prmd](https://github.com/interagent/prmd) to generate this
documentation and build JSON Schema files for the API. After editing any of the
files you can run `rake` to regenerate the README and the schema.json file upon
which it is based.

Pull requests are welcome - they'll guide us in our API development.
